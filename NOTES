CTRS VERIFIED BUGS
 - Notification timer is malfunctioning (consider making actual timer and recreating on refresh)
 - Tier update isn't done automatically anywhere (probably because it requires the notification bit, verify where it is set)

CTRS NEEDED FEATURES
 - REST route for new donation (to update things dynamically)
 - Permabuffs integration (update permabuffs and possibly make the generalized command)

CTRS OPTIONAL FEATURES
 - Autonomize /auth to fetch contributor status without needing to manually insert data into the table, or have a program/command that does that
